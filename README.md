# Datárum

Datárum is a small python library to convert Gregorian dates to Autophagian,
an Old English variant on the [French Republican calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar), 
for use in various projects. At the moment, it doesn't implement the day names, and
the year zero is the same as the republican calendar, but I might tweak that to
something cooler at some point.

## Hwý?

I appreciate the political impulse behind the French Republican calendar, as well
as its more rational system (12 months of 30 days, plus 5/6 celebratory days
at the end of the year). However, I like the aesthetics of Old English more than
the original french names for the months, so I've attempted to rougly translate
or otherwise approximate the Old English equivalents.
