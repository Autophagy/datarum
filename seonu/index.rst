Overview
========

Dat√°rum is a small python library to convert Gregorian dates to Wending,
an Old English variant on the `French Republican calendar`_, for use in
various projects.

The leap years are calculated according to the Romme rule, which uses
the 4-100-400 rule from the Gregorian calendar (a leap day becoming an
extra 6th Wending day).
